Hi! I'm Jacob Coblentz. I'm currently thinking about how companies can leverage open source geosptial solutions at [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com/).
 I've done a lot of things in my still relatively short career. So far, I've:

* Worked at a Research Assistant at the [MIT Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/)
* Worked on the data team for a national presidential campaign. 
* Ran the data arm of a redistricting firm 

I currently live in San Francisco, CA, where I was born and raised. I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics from George Washington University,
and completed graduate coursework in statistics at MIT. 
 Aside from thinking about stats and open source software during the week,
I enjoy hanging out with my cat Mr. Goji, riding bikes with [friends](http://www.sfcyclingclub.org/), and going on long walks with my partner. 

I can be reached at "ja" + my last name + 415 at gmail dot com. Always happy to chat about career stuff with people.
